## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project is a web-based dashboard built with Streamlit that uses a Machine Learning model to detect potential adulteration in raw food samples based on their sensory attributes. It provides an instant analysis of food safety and potential health risks.

*(Recommendation: Add a screenshot of your app named `app_screenshot.png` to your project folder for a professional look.)*

### Key Features
- **Interactive UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface to input food sample data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained Random Forest classifier to predict adulteration status and health risk level.
- **Visual Health Gauge**: A donut chart visually represents the predicted health risk level (Safe, Low Risk, Moderate, Toxic).
- **Prediction History**: A dashboard table logs all samples analyzed during the current session.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set it up:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Nikhileshpadhan/FoodAdulterationDetection.git](https://github.com/Nikhileshpadhan/FoodAdulterationDetection.git)
    cd FoodAdulterationDetection
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application with the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
